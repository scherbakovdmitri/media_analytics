# media_analytics (early draft version)
A set of methods to analyze social media content (Twitter, Youtube, VKontakte, Yandex.news) which I used in my PhD work.
The methods are isolated as separate R files. Some of them require user/password to be entered for social networks. Some of the require some form of manual mods before results can be obtained - provided as draft for demo purposes.
Twitter module requires external python snscrape which can be installed with pip.

Here is example of analytics of youtube channels. We can compare on xray chart how often guests of show talk about Chernyshevsky and Dostoevsky:

For twitter and VKontakte data we can compare group of fiction writers and see in which context and sentiment people tend to speak about them:
